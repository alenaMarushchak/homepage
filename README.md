# Homepage
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

## Description

Hi, this is a simple project to demonstrate my skills on **git** and **github** . If you still do not know why **github** just   
read this :bowtie: [article](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/why.html).

In this repository you can see two projects:
 * Homepage
 * Resume 
 
### Structure

```
homepage
├── README.md
├── index.html
├──  js 
     └── index.js
├──  css
     └── main.css
```

### So just enjoy it!
