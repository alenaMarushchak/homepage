# homepage
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

Hi, this is a simple project to demonstrate my skills on **git** and **github** . If you still do not know why **github** just   
read this :bowtie: [article](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/why.html).

 In this repository you can see two projects:
 * Homepage
 * Resume 

```
homepage
├── README.md
├── Homepage
└── Resume
    └── index.html
    └── js 
          └── index.js
    └── css
           └── main.css
```
### Resume
 Here you can see the code of my resume, in the folders **css** and **js** dispersed css and js files respectively. 

### Homepage 
  Here you can see my responsive, accessible, informative, credible, readable, descriptive, compatible, consistent, uncluttered, simple, secure homepage :laughing: :laughing: :laughing: 

### So just enjoy it!
